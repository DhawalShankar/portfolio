## 📖 What This Portfolio Is

This is not a traditional scrolling portfolio.

This website is designed as a **book-like experience**, where:
- each section behaves like a **page**
- content is explored **chapter by chapter**
- navigation feels intentional, calm, and readable

The goal is to present work and thinking the way a book does —
**with flow, structure, and focus**.

---

## 🧭 How to Navigate the Book

### 🖥️ Desktop Experience
- Pages open like a **book**
- Navigation uses **Next / Previous** controls
- Sections feel like **chapters**, not scroll blocks

### 📱 Mobile Experience
- Pages can be **swiped horizontally**
- Gesture-based navigation mimics real book reading
- Optimized for one-hand use

---

## 🌗 Themes & Accessibility

- Supports **Light Mode and Dark Mode**
- Global theme toggle available
- Visual balance preserved across both themes

Designed for **comfort during longer reading**, not visual noise.

## 📚 Chapters Inside the Book

- **Cover** — Introduction & identity  
- **About** — Background and mindset  
- **Projects** — Selected, meaningful work  
- **Skills** — Technologies and systems  
- **Experience** — Roles, responsibilities, collaboration  
- **Contact** — Ways to connect  

Each section is treated as a **chapter**, not a section dump.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- Book-style navigation over infinite scrolling  
- Minimal UI with deliberate motion  
- No unnecessary animations  
- Content > decoration  

This mirrors how I approach engineering:

> **Structured. Sequential. Intentional.**

---

## 🚫 What This Portfolio Is Not

- Not a flashy landing page  
- Not a list of every experiment  
- Not trend-driven  

It is meant to feel **calm, thoughtful, and readable**.

---

## 🧠 Why a Book?

A book:
- encourages **focus**
- has a **beginning, middle, and flow**
- respects the reader’s attention

This portfolio applies the same principles.
